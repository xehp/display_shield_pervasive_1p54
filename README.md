shield for pervasive display 1.54" EPD, A-MB, W.ITC

This aims to design a shield for the Pervasive Displays 1.54" EPD, A-MB, W.ITC E2154CS0C1.

The intention is to make a design that can be sent to JLCPCB for PCB and SMA manufactoring.

It is a work in progress. I usually bunch a few projects together since delivery is a large
part of the cost when ordering the PCB/SMA. So this project will finish when some other minor projects also are ready.
If someone is interested in this particular one I could speed it up a bit.
